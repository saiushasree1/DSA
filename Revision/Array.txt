Question 1: Union Of Two Sorted Arrays : 
Brute Force: insert both arrays into the set and insert all elements from set to result array and return result.
Time  : O((n+m)log(n+m));
Space : O(n+m);
Optimal    : 1.Use two pointers to traverse both the arrays simultaneously.
            2.Add smaller element to the array move the corresponding pointer.
            3.If both are equal move two pointers.
            4.Traverse total array to ensure all elements are added into the union.
Time  : O(n+m);
Space : O(n+m);
